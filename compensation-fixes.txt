FIXED Issues in Compensation Creator:

Issue 1: SQLite Type Error (FIXED)
- Problem: Boolean values were being passed directly to SQLite
- Solution: Convert boolean to 1/0 integers in createFundingTarget and updateFundingTarget methods

Issue 2: Next Paycheck Date Logic (FIXED)  
- Problem: Logic error - "if (currentDate < 1)" can never be true since dates start at 1
- Solution: Changed to "if (currentDate >= 1 && currentDate < 15)" for proper 1st-15th scheduling

Both database methods should now work correctly:
✅ Funding Target CRUD Operations should pass
✅ Next Paycheck Date Calculation should pass

Please rebuild with: npm run electron:build
Then test the Compensation Creator again!
