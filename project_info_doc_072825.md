# Personal Finance App - Project Documentation

## Project Overview

**Purpose**: Build a desktop personal finance application to automate and improve upon a current Google Sheets-based envelope budgeting system.

**Primary User**: Self-employed individual with twice-monthly variable compensation
**Future Goal**: Potential distribution to friends and eventual commercial opportunity

**Current Status**: Phase 1 COMPLETE ✅ - Foundation + Account Management UI Working
**Next Phase**: Phase 2 - Envelope System Implementation

## User's Current Google Sheets System (Requirements Basis)

### Financial Workflow
- **Income**: Self-employed, pays himself twice monthly (1st & 15th)
- **Payment Structure**: 
  - W-2 employee paycheck from own company
  - Direct dividend transfer from business
- **Payment Calculation**: Variable amounts based on:
  - Outstanding credit card balances by envelope category
  - Upcoming bills and obligations  
  - Envelope deficits to reach target funding amounts

### Account Structure
- **Multiple Bank Accounts**: 2 checking accounts, 2 savings accounts
- **Account-Envelope Relationship**: Each envelope tied to specific bank account
- **Perfect Alignment**: Account balances must always equal sum of envelopes in that account
- **Account Types**: Checking, Savings, Credit Cards (2 cards), Cash

### Envelope System Architecture

#### **Cash Envelopes** (Asset Tracking)
- **Purpose**: Track actual money in checking, savings, and cash accounts
- **Function**: Represent real cash available for spending
- **Usage**: Source of funds for bill payments and credit card payments
- **Examples**: Groceries (in Capital One Checking), Car Gas (in Morgantown Bank Checking)

#### **Debt Envelopes** (Spending Categorization)  
- **Purpose**: Categorize credit card purchases by spending type
- **Function**: Track what credit card debt is for (groceries, gas, etc.)
- **Usage**: Determine how much to pay from corresponding cash envelopes
- **Important**: Do NOT represent available cash - only debt categorization

### Transaction Status System

#### **Bank Account Transactions**
- **Not Posted**: Future scheduled transactions that haven't occurred yet
- **Pending**: Transaction shows in online banking but hasn't cleared
- **Cleared**: Transaction has fully cleared the bank

#### **Credit Card Transactions**
- **Unpaid**: Transaction counts toward debt envelope balance
- **Paid**: Transaction removed from debt envelope balance (paid off)

### Credit Card Payment Workflow
1. **Review Debt Envelopes**: Check balances in each debt category (groceries, gas, etc.)
2. **Build Payment**: Decide how much to pay from each corresponding cash envelope
3. **Single Payment**: Make one bank payment to credit card company
4. **Multi-Envelope Allocation**: Track which cash envelopes contributed to payment
5. **Cross-Envelope Flexibility**: Can pay grocery debt using gas envelope money (creates automatic envelope transfer)
6. **Status Update**: Mark credit card transactions as "Paid"

### Compensation Creator System
- **Planning Tool**: Calculate twice-monthly self-employment payments
- **Debt Reference**: Display current credit card debt by envelope category
- **Funding Targets**: Set and persist envelope funding goals with descriptions
- **Target Types**:
  - Monthly minimums (e.g., "$300 minimum" for car gas)
  - Per-paycheck amounts (e.g., "$523.84 per paycheck" for mortgage)
  - Monthly stipends (e.g., "$150/mo. stipend, $300 min" for electricity)
- **Automatic Split**: 75% W-2 paycheck / 25% dividend calculation
- **Forward Planning**: Enter future transactions to prevent accidental overspending

### Data Entry Patterns
- **Transaction Frequency**: Credit card entries 1-2 times per week
- **Forward Planning**: Enter future transactions as "Pending" to reduce available balances
- **Envelope Transfers**: Handle negative balances by transferring between envelopes
- **Batch Processing**: Plan entire pay cycles in advance for 1-2 week roadmaps

## Technical Architecture (Implemented)

### **Tech Stack: Electron + React + SQLite + TypeScript**

#### **Why This Stack**
- **Desktop-first**: Native desktop app with eventual mobile transition path
- **Data Security**: Local SQLite database - no cloud dependencies
- **Easy Distribution**: Simple installer files for sharing with friends
- **Component Testing**: React architecture enables incremental testing
- **Commercial Viability**: Proven stack for financial applications

#### **Database Schema (Implemented)**
```sql
-- Core Tables (IMPLEMENTED & TESTED)
accounts (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  type TEXT CHECK (type IN ('checking', 'savings', 'credit_card', 'cash')),
  initial_balance REAL NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
  current_balance REAL NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
  created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  updated_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
)

-- Future Tables (PLANNED)
envelopes (id, name, account_id, type, spending_limit, created_at, updated_at)
transactions (id, account_id, envelope_id, amount, date, type, status, description, created_at)
account_transfers (id, from_account_id, to_account_id, amount, date, description, created_at)
envelope_transfers (id, from_envelope_id, to_envelope_id, amount, date, description, created_at)
credit_card_payments (id, credit_card_account_id, total_amount, date, description, created_at)
payment_allocations (id, payment_id, envelope_id, amount, created_at)
envelope_funding_targets (id, envelope_id, target_amount, target_type, description, created_at, updated_at)
```

#### **Implemented Database Operations - 100% TESTED ✅**
- ✅ **Create Account**: All 4 types (checking, savings, credit_card, cash)
- ✅ **Read Operations**: By ID, all accounts, by type, with filtering
- ✅ **Update Account**: Name, balance, and details
- ✅ **Delete Account**: With proper validation
- ✅ **Data Persistence**: Survives app restarts
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Invalid data rejection
- ✅ **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript integration

#### **Key Design Principles**
- **Account-Envelope Integrity**: Envelopes always tied to specific accounts
- **Atomic Transactions**: Multi-step operations succeed or fail completely  
- **Status-Driven Logic**: Transaction status determines balance calculations
- **Perfect Balance Alignment**: Account totals must equal envelope totals
