## User's Current Google Sheets System (Requirements Basis)

### Financial Workflow
- **Income**: Self-employed, pays himself twice monthly (1st & 15th)
- **Payment Structure**: 
  - W-2 employee paycheck from own company
  - Direct dividend transfer from business
- **Payment Calculation**: Variable amounts based on:
  - Outstanding credit card balances by envelope category
  - Upcoming bills and obligations  
  - Envelope deficits to reach target funding amounts

### Account Structure
- **Multiple Bank Accounts**: 2 checking accounts, 2 savings accounts
- **Account-Envelope Relationship**: Each envelope tied to specific bank account
- **Perfect Alignment**: Account balances must always equal sum of envelopes in that account
- **Account Types**: Checking, Savings, Credit Cards (2 cards), Cash

### Envelope System Architecture

#### **Cash Envelopes** (Asset Tracking)
- **Purpose**: Track actual money in checking, savings, and cash accounts
- **Function**: Represent real cash available for spending
- **Usage**: Source of funds for bill payments and credit card payments
- **Examples**: Groceries (in Capital One Checking), Car Gas (in Morgantown Bank Checking)

#### **Debt Envelopes** (Spending Categorization)  
- **Purpose**: Categorize credit card purchases by spending type
- **Function**: Track what credit card debt is for (groceries, gas, etc.)
- **Usage**: Determine how much to pay from corresponding cash envelopes
- **Important**: Do NOT represent available cash - only debt categorization

### Transaction Status System

#### **Bank Account Transactions**
- **Not Posted**: Future scheduled transactions that haven't occurred yet
- **Pending**: Transaction shows in online banking but hasn't cleared
- **Cleared**: Transaction has fully cleared the bank

#### **Credit Card Transactions**
- **Unpaid**: Transaction counts toward debt envelope balance
- **Paid**: Transaction removed from debt envelope balance (paid off)

### Credit Card Payment Workflow
1. **Review Debt Envelopes**: Check balances in each debt category (groceries, gas, etc.)
2. **Build Payment**: Decide how much to pay from each corresponding cash envelope
3. **Single Payment**: Make one bank payment to credit card company
4. **Multi-Envelope Allocation**: Track which cash envelopes contributed to payment
5. **Cross-Envelope Flexibility**: Can pay grocery debt using gas envelope money (creates automatic envelope transfer)
6. **Status Update**: Mark credit card transactions as "Paid"

### Compensation Creator System
- **Planning Tool**: Calculate twice-monthly self-employment payments
- **Debt Reference**: Display current credit card debt by envelope category
- **Funding Targets**: Set and persist envelope funding goals with descriptions
- **Target Types**:
  - Monthly minimums (e.g., "$300 minimum" for car gas)
  - Per-paycheck amounts (e.g., "$523.84 per paycheck" for mortgage)
  - Monthly stipends (e.g., "$150/mo. stipend, $300 min" for electricity)
- **Automatic Split**: 75% W-2 paycheck / 25% dividend calculation
- **Forward Planning**: Enter future transactions to prevent accidental overspending

### Data Entry Patterns
- **Transaction Frequency**: Credit card entries 1-2 times per week
- **Forward Planning**: Enter future transactions as "Pending" to reduce available balances
- **Envelope Transfers**: Handle negative balances by transferring between envelopes
- **Batch Processing**: Plan entire pay cycles in advance for 1-2 week roadmaps

## Technical Architecture (Implemented)

### **Tech Stack: Electron + React + SQLite + TypeScript**

#### **Why This Stack**
- **Desktop-first**: Native desktop app with eventual mobile transition path
- **Data Security**: Local SQLite database - no cloud dependencies
- **Easy Distribution**: Simple installer files for sharing with friends
- **Component Testing**: React architecture enables incremental testing
- **Commercial Viability**: Proven stack for financial applications

#### **Database Schema (Implemented)**
```sql
-- Core Tables (IMPLEMENTED)
accounts (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  type TEXT CHECK (type IN ('checking', 'savings', 'credit_card', 'cash')),
  initial_balance REAL NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
  current_balance REAL NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
  created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  updated_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
)

-- Future Tables (PLANNED)
envelopes (id, name, account_id, type, spending_limit, created_at, updated_at)
transactions (id, account_id, envelope_id, amount, date, type, status, description, created_at)
account_transfers (id, from_account_id, to_account_id, amount, date, description, created_at)
envelope_transfers (id, from_envelope_id, to_envelope_id, amount, date, description, created_at)
credit_card_payments (id, credit_card_account_id, total_amount, date, description, created_at)
payment_allocations (id, payment_id, envelope_id, amount, created_at)
envelope_funding_targets (id, envelope_id, target_amount, target_type, description, created_at, updated_at)
```

#### **Implemented Database Operations**
- ✅ **Create Account**: All 4 types (checking, savings, credit_card, cash)
- ✅ **Read Operations**: By ID, all accounts, by type, with filtering
- ✅ **Update Account**: Name, balance, and details
- ✅ **Delete Account**: With proper validation
- ✅ **Data Persistence**: Survives app restarts
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Invalid data rejection
- ✅ **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript integration

#### **Key Design Principles**
- **Account-Envelope Integrity**: Envelopes always tied to specific accounts
- **Atomic Transactions**: Multi-step operations succeed or fail completely  
- **Status-Driven Logic**: Transaction status determines balance calculations
- **Perfect Balance Alignment**: Account totals must equal envelope totals

## Implementation Details for Next Session

### **Recommended Claude Code Approach for Account Management UI**

**Files to Create/Modify:**
- `src/components/AccountForm.tsx` - Account creation/editing form
- `src/components/AccountList.tsx` - Display all accounts with actions
- `src/components/AccountItem.tsx` - Individual account display component
- `src/pages/AccountManagement.tsx` - Main account management page
- Update navigation in `src/App.tsx`

**Key Features to Implement:**
1. **Account Creation Form**:
   - Dropdown for account type (checking, savings, credit_card, cash)
   - Text input for account name with validation
   - Number input for initial balance
   - Form validation with error messages
   - Save/Cancel functionality

2. **Account List Display**:
   - Table or card layout showing all accounts
   - Display: name, type, current balance, created date
   - Sort by name, type, balance, or date
   - Filter by account type
   - Edit/Delete buttons for each account

3. **Account Editing**:
   - Inline editing or modal dialog
   - Pre-populate form with existing data
   - Validation for changes
   - Confirm/Cancel options

4. **Account Deletion**:
   - Confirmation dialog before deletion
   - Check for dependencies (future: envelopes tied to account)
   - Success/error feedback

### **Database Integration Points**
- Use existing `window.electronAPI.accounts.*` methods
- Implement proper error handling for all operations
- Update UI state after successful database operations
- Handle loading states during async operations

## Key Reminders for Future Sessions

1. **Solid Foundation**: Database layer is 100% tested and reliable
2. **Account-Envelope Integrity**: This core principle must guide all future development
3. **Status-Driven Logic**: Transaction status determines what affects balances
4. **Multi-Envelope Payments**: Core differentiator from simple budgeting apps
5. **Forward Planning**: System must support entering future transactions
6. **Commercial Potential**: Build with sharing/distribution in mind
7. **Claude Code Synergy**: Continue leveraging Claude Code for implementation, chat for planning
8. **Incremental Testing**: Test each UI component thoroughly before proceeding
9. **User Experience Focus**: Make the interface intuitive for non-technical users
10. **Data Integrity**: Always validate user input and maintain database consistency
11. **Showcase Development**: Document progress for GitHub repository and professional showcase
