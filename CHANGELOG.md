## [2.9.0] - 2025-08-09

### 🐛 Fixed - Critical Transaction Amount Bug

This release fixes a critical bug where debit transactions were incorrectly adding to envelope balances instead of subtracting from them.

### 🎯 Issue Discovered
**Problem**: Debit transactions were increasing envelope balances instead of decreasing them
- Created $500 credit → Balance correctly increased to $500
- Created $500 debit → Balance incorrectly increased to $1,000 (should have decreased to $0)

### 🔍 Root Cause Analysis
- **Database Storage**: All transaction amounts were stored as positive values regardless of type
- **SQL Views**: The `envelope_balances_by_status` view SUMs all transaction amounts
- **Math Error**: Positive debit amounts + positive credit amounts = incorrectly inflated balances
- **Impact**: Envelope balances showed incorrect totals, making financial tracking unreliable

### 📝 Technical Solution

#### TransactionManagement.tsx Changes
- **handleCreate**: Debits now use negative amounts (`-Math.abs(amount)`)
- **handleUpdate**: Same fix applied for editing transactions
- **Amount Display**: UI always shows positive values for user clarity
- **handleEdit**: Converts stored negative values to positive for form display
- **Transaction List**: Shows absolute values in the table

#### Code Fix Applied
```javascript
// Before (BUG):
amount: formData.amount, // Always positive

// After (FIXED):
amount: formData.type === 'debit' ? -Math.abs(formData.amount) : Math.abs(formData.amount),
```

### 🛠️ Fix Implementation
- **Fix Script Created**: `fix_transaction_amounts\fix-transaction-amount-bug.bat`
- **Automated Process**: Script backs up original file and applies comprehensive fix
- **Build Integration**: Uses standard `simple-reliable-build.bat` after fix
- **Documentation**: Complete fix documentation in `fix_transaction_amounts\FIX_DOCUMENTATION.md`

### ✅ Results
- **Debit Transactions**: Now correctly subtract from envelope balances
- **Credit Transactions**: Continue to correctly add to envelope balances
- **Math Integrity**: $500 credit + $500 debit = $0 balance ✅
- **User Experience**: UI still shows positive values for clarity
- **Database Accuracy**: Stored values now mathematically correct

### 📊 Testing Verification
- Test envelope with $0 balance ✅
- Added $500 credit → Balance = $500 ✅
- Added $500 debit → Balance = $0 ✅
- Transaction amounts display as positive in UI ✅
- Database stores correct signed values ✅

### 🎯 User Impact
- **Critical Fix**: Financial calculations now accurate
- **Data Integrity**: Envelope balances reflect true financial state
- **Confidence Restored**: Users can trust balance calculations
- **Backward Compatibility**: Existing transactions may need correction

### 📝 Important Notes
- Existing transactions created before this fix may have incorrect signs
- Users should verify and potentially recreate transactions created during testing
- Future transactions will automatically use correct signed amounts
- Standard build process (`simple-reliable-build.bat`) continues to work normally

## [2.8.0] - 2025-08-09

### 🔧 Fixed - UI Polish & Data Integrity Issues

This release resolves three critical user-facing issues discovered during production use, improving both the user interface and data persistence.

### 🎯 Issues Fixed
1. **Duplicate Navigation Button** - Removed redundant "Back to Home" button from Envelope Management
2. **Missing Envelope Names** - Fixed Credit Card Payment Wizard to display both envelope names and amounts
3. **Transaction History Data Loss** - Resolved "Unknown Account" and "Unknown Envelope" display issues

### 🔍 Root Causes Identified
- **Duplicate Button**: Page header had unnecessary second navigation button
- **Missing Names**: CSS/styling issue prevented envelope names from displaying
- **Data Loss**: Component was trying to enrich data instead of using database-provided values

### 📝 Technical Implementation

#### EnvelopeManagement.tsx
- Removed duplicate back button from page header
- Kept only the top navigation bar button
- Result: Clean, professional interface

#### CreditCardPaymentWizard.tsx
- Enhanced inline styles for cash envelope display
- Added explicit styling for both name and amount
- Used inline grid layout for better control
- Result: Clear visibility of envelope names with amounts

#### TransactionManagement.tsx
- Fixed loadTransactions function to use database-provided names
- Removed unnecessary data enrichment logic
- Database JOINs already provide account/envelope names
- Result: Historical data preserved correctly between sessions

### 🛠️ Build System Refinement
- Confirmed `simple-reliable-build.bat` as standard build process
- Eliminated need for specialized build scripts
- One build command works for all changes
- Simplified development workflow

### ✅ Quality Improvements
- **User Experience**: Cleaner interface without duplicate controls
- **Data Visibility**: All financial context visible in payment wizard
- **Data Integrity**: Transaction history maintains complete relationships
- **Code Quality**: Removed unnecessary data manipulation logic
- **Build Simplicity**: Standardized on single build process

### 📊 Testing Verification
- Envelope Management: No duplicate buttons ✅
- Credit Card Payment: Names and amounts visible ✅
- Transaction History: Correct account/envelope names ✅
- Build Process: Consistent and reliable ✅

### 🎯 User Impact
- Better navigation experience without confusion
- Clear understanding of payment sources
- Reliable historical transaction tracking
- Confidence in data persistence

## [2.7.0] - 2025-08-09

### 🔍 CRITICAL DISCOVERY: UI Changes Must Use Inline Styles in .tsx Files

This release documents a critical discovery about how to make UI/CSS changes in the application, resolving confusion about why CSS file modifications weren't working.

### 🎯 Discovery - Inline Styles Override CSS Files
- **Root Cause Identified**: Application uses inline styles in React components that override external CSS files
- **CSS Files Don't Work**: Changes to App.css, design-system.css have no effect on component styling
- **Inline Styles Priority**: React inline styles (`style={{}}`) have higher specificity than CSS
- **Component Files Are Key**: All UI changes must be made in .tsx files, not .css files
- **Build System Works**: Confirmed simple-reliable-build.bat successfully compiles all changes

### 🔧 Fixed - CSS Update Process
- **Wrong Approach**: Modifying CSS files (App.css, design-system.css) - NO EFFECT
- **Wrong Scripts**: force-css-update.bat, cache clearing - UNNECESSARY
- **Correct Approach**: Edit inline styles directly in App.tsx and component files
- **Correct Build**: Use simple-reliable-build.bat - works perfectly
- **Test Successful**: Yellow banner, red border, light blue background all displayed correctly

### 📚 Enhanced - Documentation
- **Project Info Updated**: Created financial_app_project_info_080925.md with complete CSS discovery details
- **Clear Instructions**: Documented exactly where and how to make UI changes
- **Lessons Learned**: Captured all attempted approaches and their results
- **Future Reference**: Clear guide for making UI modifications without trial and error

### 🛠️ Technical Understanding
- **Style Locations**: Inline styles found in `style={{}}` attributes in JSX
- **File Structure**: UI changes in src/App.tsx, src/components/*.tsx, src/pages/*.tsx
- **Build Process**: simple-reliable-build.bat → npm run start (no special CSS commands needed)
- **No Cache Issues**: Build system works correctly, CSS caching was never the problem

### ✅ Verified - Working Process
```
How to Make UI Changes:
1. Edit .tsx file (not .css)
2. Modify inline styles: style={{property: 'value'}}
3. Run: simple-reliable-build.bat
4. Run: npm run start
5. Changes appear immediately!

What NOT to do:
- Don't edit CSS files for component styling
- Don't use CSS-specific build scripts
- Don't clear caches (unnecessary)
- Don't use force-css-update.bat
```

### 🎯 Test Results
- **Yellow Banner**: ✅ Displayed at top with test message
- **Red Border**: ✅ 10px solid red border visible
- **Light Blue Background**: ✅ Background color #E3F2FD applied
- **Build System**: ✅ Changes compiled and displayed correctly
- **User Confirmation**: ✅ "Success!" - All test changes visible

### 📝 Key Learning
**CRITICAL**: React inline styles in .tsx files override CSS files. To change UI appearance:
- Find the component file (.tsx)
- Locate the inline style attribute
- Modify the style properties directly
- Build with simple-reliable-build.bat
- Changes will appear immediately

This discovery eliminates confusion and enables rapid UI modifications going forward.
