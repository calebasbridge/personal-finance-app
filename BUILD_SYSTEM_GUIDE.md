## 🎨 CSS/UI Specific Tips

### CSS Changes:
- In dev mode: Instant updates
- In production: Run `quick-ui-rebuild.bat`
- CSS is bundled into bundle.js by webpack

### Adding New CSS Files:
1. Import in your .tsx component: `import './styles/newfile.css'`
2. Dev mode will pick it up automatically
3. For production: Run a rebuild

### CSS Not Updating?
1. Clear browser cache: Ctrl+Shift+R in DevTools
2. Delete `node_modules/.cache` folder
3. Run `ultra-reliable-build.bat`

After a successful build, your `dist/` folder should have:

├── index.html     (Entry HTML)
├── main.js        (Electron main process)
└── preload.js     (IPC bridge)
```

All 4 files are required for the app to run!
