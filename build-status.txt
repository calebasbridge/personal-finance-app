Build test completed. Ready to try npm run electron:build again.

Changes made:
1. Fixed type mismatch in electron.d.ts for target_type
2. Removed duplicate global declarations from CompensationCreatorTest.tsx
3. Updated all window.electronAPI calls to use the safe utility
4. Updated TypeScriptTest.tsx to use the utility as well

The application should now build without TypeScript errors.
